# Arithmetic_Operations-TA-Notes

## About This Repository

I am a Teaching Assistant for the Intro to C Programming course (January 2026 to April 2026), and this repository contains lab instruction materials and example programs created to help students during lab sessions.

## Overview
This repository contains instructional materials and example programs used during Intro to C Programming lab sessions. Lab 2 focuses on arithmetic operations, integer vs float division, type casting, and operator precedence—fundamental concepts that students often find tricky when starting with C programming.

These materials were designed to help beginner programmers understand not just the "how" but also the "why" behind C's arithmetic behavior, with plenty of examples showing common mistakes and how to avoid them.
